version 1.4
	* Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in a
	  StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when running cobertura-report
	  (Thanks to Grzegorz Lukasik)
	* Fixed a bug where classes without coverage data ("N/A") were
	  not always sorted correctly in the HTML report (Thanks to
	  Olivier Parent)
	* Fixed a bug where the code complexity column would not always
	  sort correctly in locales that use a comma to split the decimal
	  part of the number (Thanks to Oliver Parent)

version 1.3
	* Increased speed of HTML reports by filtering the files read
	  in to determine cyclomatic complexity numbers on.
	* In the lower left pane of the HTML reports, classes are now
	  sorted only by their class name (instead of by their package
	  name plus class name).
	* Changed the format of the XML reports to something that
	  is hopefully easier to use and more natural.  This
	  unfortunately breaks backward compatability.
	* We're using a DTD for the XML reports now.  See
	  http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/xml/coverage-01.dtd
	* Added the ability to specify the location of the coverage
	  data files from the ant tasks and the command line.
	* More user-friendly error checking and reporting.

version 1.2
	* Fix a bug that caused the XML reports to be invalid XML
	  (they were missing the </package> tag).
	* Use Java 1.4 pattern matching and remove Jakarta ORO.

version 1.1
	* Fix a bug in the syntax highlighting code of the HTML report
	  generation.  Previously, the highlighting for single quotes
	  containing "\\" would not end correctly.
	* Check the third party jars into CVS using the correct CVS
	  substition flag (binary, not ASCII).
	* Temporary files created by the instrument ant task and merge
	  ant task are now deleted after the ant task finishes.
	* Switch the instrumentation classes to use ASM instead of
	  Apache BCEL.  There are three benefits to this:
	  1. BCEL was throwing exceptions with some source code compiled
	     with JDK 1.5--ASM works fine.
	  2. ASM is licensed under the revised BSD license, which
	     is compatable with the GPL, which allows us to remove
	     the questionable exception for BCEL.
	  3. Instrumentation is about 5 times faster with ASM than BCEL.
	* Modify the HTML reports so that classes without line number
	  information will appear as "Not Applicable."  This includes
	  skeleton classes, stub classes, interfaces, or anything not
	  compiled with debug=true.
	* Fix bug #1151777 with a patch from Jeremy Thomerson.
	  Previously we were not escaping some characters correctly in the
	  generated XML coverage report (specificially < and >).
	* Set the class-path in the cobertura.jar manifest file correctly.
	* Fill feature request #1151779 with a patch from Jeremy Thomerson.
	  This changes the structure of the XML report so that <classes> are
	  enclosed inside <packages>.

version 1.0
	* Forked jcoverage 1.0.5 (although the version in the source says 1.0.4).
	  All original code is copyright 2003 jcoverage ltd.  Kurt Guenther
	  highlighted a bug in the branch coverage, was was fixed.
	* Applied a patch from Joakim Erdfelt to fix a bug where jcoverage
	  would fail to instrument classes if you attempted to instrument a
	  very large number of classes (in the hundreds).
	* Rewrote the HTML reporting and included code complexity in the output.
