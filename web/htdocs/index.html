<h1>What is Cobertura?</h1>

<p>
Cobertura is a free Java tool that calculates the percentage of code
accessed by tests.  It can be used to identify which parts of your
Java program are lacking test coverage.  It is based on jcoverage.
</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>Can be executed from ant or from the command line.</li>
<li>Instruments Java bytecode after it has been compiled.</li>
<li>Can generate reports in HTML or XML.</li>
<li>
Shows the percentage of lines and branches covered for each
class, each package, and for the overall project.
</li>
<li>
Shows the McCabe cyclomatic code complexity of each class, and
the average cyclomatic code complexity for each package, and for
the overall product.
</li>
<li>
Can sort HTML results by class name, percent of lines covered,
percent of branches covered, etc.  And can sort in ascending or
decending order.
</li>
</ul>

We've added John Lewis as a developer on the project!  The
more the merrier.  He contributed some of the bigger changes
in Cobertura 1.8, and he's been pretty active on the

<p>
After 4 long months we've released Cobertura 1.8!  Lots of good
changes in this release: show the total number of lines and
branches in the HTML report, support for Groovy, allow multiple
JVMs to cleanly write to the same data file, and more robust
instrumentation of archives (and even archives inside of
archives!)  See below for the full list of changes.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Ability to have multiple &lt;ignore/&gt; regular expressions
in the instrument task (Alexei Yudichev).
</li>

<li>
Ability to specify a minimum branch coverage rate and
line coverage rate for each package when using
cobertura-check.
</li>

<li>
Show the number of lines and branches covered and the
total number of lines and branches in the HTML report.
</li>

<li>
Support for instrumenting classes written in Groovy.
</li>

<li>
Lock the data file before trying to write to it.  This
allows multiple JVMs (or multiple class loaders within
a single JVM) to write to the same coverage data file
with no problems (John Lewis).
</li>

<li>
Ability to instrument classes on a given classpath
instead of specifying filesets (John Lewis).
</li>

<li>
Ability to specify which classes will be instrumented
using regular expressions (John Lewis).
</li>

<li>
Archives within archives will be instrumented if you
specify an includeClassname regular expression (John
Lewis).
</li>

<li>
If instrumenting an archive, remove any signatures
and checksums, since they will no longer be valid (John
Lewis).
</li>

<li>
Removed the Class-Path line from cobertura.jar.  You may
need to modify your Cobertura taskdef to include the jars
in Cobertura's 'lib' directory.  See our Ant task web
page for an example.
</li>

<li>
Reorganized libs into a flatter directory structure--you
may need to update your ant scripts.
</li>

<li>
Upgraded from asm 2.1 to asm 2.2.1.  No code changes were
needed.
</li>

<li>
Copied portions of classes from JavaNCSS into Cobertura
so that we don't need to include the entire JavaNCSS and
CCL jars.
</li>
</ul>

Benoit Xhenseval and the
<a href="http://qalab.sourceforge.net/index.html">QALab</a> folks
have added support for Cobertura to their product.  From their
website, "[t]his project collects and consolidate data from several
QA tools, like pmd, checkstyle, FindBugs, Cobertura and Simian and
keeps track of them overtime. This allows developers, architects
and project managers alike to be presented with a trend of the QA
statistics of their project."

We've just released Cobertura 1.7.  We fixed the problems with
the merge task,
as well as a few other bugs.  The full list of changes is below.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
log4j is no longer used by the Cobertura classes that are
accessed by instrumented Java code.  This means you will
not need to add log4j to your project's classpath in order
to use Cobertura (but log4j is still required when
instrumenting and reporting).
</li>

<li>
Upgraded from asm 2.0 to asm 2.1.  No code changes were
needed.
</li>

<li>
Improved the merge task.  It should work correctly now
(with help from  Björn Beskow).
</li>

<li>
Fixed the ability to specify a data file in the merge
task.
</li>

<li>
Changed the command-line interface to the merge task and
added a helper batch/shell script.
</li>

<li>
Added better error checking to the merge task.
</li>

<li>
Fixed a bug where an empty or incomplete coverage data
file would be written when you test classes inside Tomcat,
and you stop Tomcat using the shutdown.bat or shutdown.sh
scripts.  This would result in an EOFException when
running cobertura-report.
</li>

<li>
Added support for classes compiled with AspectJ.
</li>
</ul>

As promised, we've just released Cobertura 1.6 which includes
support for generating reports using different source trees
and instrumenting many directories of classes with one call to
cobertura-instrument.  See our
<a href="anttaskreference.html">ant task reference</a> for
examples.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Can now use multiple filesets in the cobertura-instrument
task (Thanks to Grzegorz Lukasik).
</li>

<li>
Can now use multiple filesets in the cobertura-report task
(Thanks to Jeremy Thomerson, Grzegorz Lukasik and James Seigel).
</li>

<li>
No longer using the Java version of GNU GetOpt
</li>

<li>
Fixed a bug where the total number of classes displayed in
the HTML report included anonymous classes when it should
not have.

We've decided to release Cobertura 1.5.  This release includes
a lot of good changes.  However, it does <i>not</i> yet support
instrumenting multiple directories for classes or generating a
report using multiple source directories.  Cobertura 1.6
will include both of these enhancements, and will hopefully be
released in about two weeks.
</p>

<p>
The changes in 1.5 are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Shortened the header shown when running Cobertura (Thanks
to Jarkko Viinamäki).
</li>

<li>
Don't save the data file twice after instrumenting.
</li>

<li>
Print a warning when running cobertura-report with a
data file that does not contain information from the
instrument step.
</li>

<li>
When instrumenting, you can now specify a zip, jar, war,
ear or sar file and Cobertura will instrument any classes
inside of the archive.  You must explicity give the name
of the archive when instrumenting--giving the name of the
directory containing the archive will not work (Thanks to
Grzegorz Lukasik).
</li>

<li>
Fixed a bug where the class list in the HTML reports did
not show multiple classes with the same name, but in
different packages.
</li>

<li>
Add a timestamp and version number to all HTML reports.
</li>

<li>
Add a timestamp and version number to all XML reports.
</li>

<li>
Add the combined line-rate and branch-rate for all
packages to all XML reports.
</li>

<li>
Fixed the merge task (Thanks to Mark Sinke).
</li>

<li>
The check task now supports checking against a project's
total branch and line coverage rates (Thanks to Nathan
Wilson).
</li>

<li>
The check ant task now allows you to fail the ant build,
if desired (Thanks to Nathan Wilson).
</li>

<li>
The check task can set an ant property to "true" on
failure (Thanks to Alex Ruiz).
</li>

<li>
Changed some of the parameters for the check task.  See
the online documentation for usage information.
</li>

<li>
The command line Windows batch scripts work better.

Some bugs sprung up after we released the last version, so we
decided to release 1.4 (after fixing the bugs, of course).
</p>

<p>
The changes in 1.4 are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in a
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when running cobertura-report
(Thanks to Grzegorz Lukasik).
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug where classes without coverage data ("N/A") were
not always sorted correctly in the HTML report (Thanks to
Olivier Parent).
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug where the code complexity column would not always
sort correctly in locales that use a comma to split the decimal
part of the number (Thanks to Olivier Parent).
</li>
<li>
Show "N/A" in the branch column of the HTML report for classes
and packages that do not have any branches.

A little over two months later we've released version 1.3.  There
were some big changes to the code that will hopefully make
future development a bit smoother.  And of course, there's that
"real life" thing that always delays things.
</p>

<p>
We've added some <a href="anttaskreference.html">ant task</a> and
<a href="commandlinereference.html">command line</a> examples to
the web page.  Please
<a href="mailto:cobertura-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">let us know</a>
if you see any mistakes, or if you find something that needs
clarification.
</p>

<p>
The changes in 1.3 are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Increased speed of HTML reports by filtering the files read
in to determine cyclomatic complexity numbers on.
</li>
<li>
In the lower left pane of the HTML reports, classes are now
sorted only by their class name (instead of by their package
name plus class name).
</li>
<li>
Changed the format of the XML reports to something that
is hopefully easier to use and more natural.  This
unfortunately breaks backward compatability.
</li>
<li>
We're using a DTD for the XML reports now.  See
http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/xml/coverage-01.dtd
</li>
<li>
Added the ability to specify the location of the coverage
data files from the ant tasks and the command line.
</li>
<li>
More user-friendly error checking and reporting.

We decided to release Cobertura 1.2 because of a bug in the XML
reports in 1.1.  If you use the XML reports you'll definitely
want to upgrade, otherwise you're safe with 1.1.  Also, Cobertura
1.2 (and 1.1, and maybe 1.0) requires a 1.4 or newer JVM.  Is this
a problem for anyone?  If so, please send an email to our mailing list
(<a href="mailto:cobertura-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">cobertura-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>)
and let us know what version of the JVM you would like to use.
</p>

<p>
Here are the changes in 1.2:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fix a bug that caused the XML reports to be invalid XML
(they were missing the &lt;/package&gt; tag).</li>
<li>
Use Java 1.4 pattern matching and remove Jakarta ORO.

Just released 1.1!  It contains a few bug fixes, some feature
improvements, and performance enhancements.  Here's the list of
changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fix a bug in the syntax highlighting code of the HTML report
generation.  Previously, the highlighting for single quotes
containing "\\" would not end correctly.
</li>

<li>
Check the third party jars into CVS using the correct CVS
substition flag (binary, not ASCII).
</li>

<li>
Temporary files created by the instrument ant task and merge
ant task are now deleted after the ant task finishes.
</li>

<li>
Switch the instrumentation classes to use ASM instead of
Apache BCEL.  There are three benefits to this:
<ol>
  <li>
  BCEL was throwing exceptions with some source code compiled
  with JDK 1.5--ASM works fine.
  </li>
  <li>
  ASM is licensed under the revised BSD license, which
  is compatable with the GPL, which allows us to remove
  the questionable exception for BCEL from the license.
  </li>
  <li>
  Instrumentation is about 5 times faster with ASM than BCEL.
  </li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Modify the HTML reports so that classes without line number
information will appear as "Not Applicable."  This includes
skeleton classes, stub classes, interfaces, or anything not
compiled with debug=true.
</li>

<li>
Fix bug #1151777 with a patch from Jeremy Thomerson.
Previously we were not escaping some characters correctly in the
generated XML coverage report (specificially &lt; and &gt;).
</li>

<li>
Set the class-path in the cobertura.jar manifest file correctly.
</li>

<li>
Fill feature request #1151779 with a patch from Jeremy Thomerson.
This changes the structure of the XML report so that &lt;classes&gt;
are enclosed inside &lt;packages&gt;.

Alright, everything is in CVS now and I've released 1.0.  Please
try it out and file bug reports for anything that doesn't work for
you.  I should point out that the original jcoverage has an
Eclipse plugin.  I don't use the plugin, and haven't tested it
in Cobertura, so I'm not providing a package for it.  However, I left
the build steps for the Eclipse plugin in place, so if you want
to use it you should be able to download a source distributable and
compile yourself.  The major changes between Cobertura 1.0 and
jcoverage 1.0.5 are below.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Applied a patch from Joakim Erdfelt to fix a bug where jcoverage
would fail to instrument classes if you attempted to instrument a
very large number of classes (in the hundreds).
</li>
<li>
Rewrote the HTML reporting and included code complexity in the output.
I should point out that parts of these reports are influenced by the
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/reference/plugins/jcoverage/">Maven
Jcoverage plugin</a>, the
<a href="http://www.cenqua.com/clover/">Clover</a> reports, and
the JUnit HTML reports.
