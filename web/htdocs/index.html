<h1>What is Cobertura?</h1>

<p>
Cobertura is a free Java tool that calculates the percentage of code
accessed by tests.  It can be used to identify which parts of your
Java program are lacking test coverage.  It is based on jcoverage.
</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>Can be executed from ant or from the command line.</li>
<li>Instruments Java bytecode after it has been compiled.</li>
<li>Can generate reports in HTML or XML.</li>
<li>
Shows percent of lines coveraged and branches coveraged for each
class, package, and for the overall project.
</li>
<li>
Shows the McCabe cyclomatic code complexity of each class, and
the average cyclomatic code complexity for each package, and for
the overall product.
</li>
<li>
Can sort HTML results by class name, percent of lines covered,
percent of branches covered, etc.  And can sort in ascending or
decending order.
</li>
</ul>

Alright, everything is in CVS now and I've released 1.0.  Please
try it out and file bug reports for anything that doesn't work for
you.  I should point out that the original jcoverage has an
Eclipse plugin.  I don't use the plugin, and haven't tested it
in Cobertura, so I'm providing a package for it.  However, I left
the build steps for the Eclipse plugin in place, so if you want
to use it you should be able to download a source distributable and
compile yourself.  The major changes between Cobertura 1.0 and
jcoverage 1.0.5 are below.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Applied a patch from Joakim Erdfelt to fix a bug where jcoverage
would fail to instrument classes if you attempted to instrument a
very large number of classes (in the hundreds).
</li>
<li>
Rewrote the HTML reporting and included code complexity in the output.
</li>
</ul>

I uploaded the web page and did some initial project setup.  I'll
give my code a good once-over then import it to CVS soon.
