<h1>What is Cobertura?</h1>

<p>
Cobertura is a free Java tool that calculates the percentage of code
accessed by tests.  It can be used to identify which parts of your
Java program are lacking test coverage.  It is based on jcoverage.
</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>Can be executed from ant or from the command line.</li>
<li>Instruments Java bytecode after it has been compiled.</li>
<li>Can generate reports in HTML or XML.</li>
<li>
Shows percent of lines coveraged and branches coveraged for each
class, package, and for the overall project.
</li>
<li>
Shows the McCabe cyclomatic code complexity of each class, and
the average cyclomatic code complexity for each package, and for
the overall product.
</li>
<li>
Can sort HTML results by class name, percent of lines covered,
percent of branches covered, etc.  And can sort in ascending or
decending order.
</li>
</ul>

We decided to release Cobertura 1.2 because of a bug in the XML
reports in 1.1.  If you use the XML reports you'll definitely
want to upgrade, otherwise you're safe with 1.1.  Also, Cobertura
1.2 (and 1.1, and maybe 1.0) requires a 1.4 or newer JVM.  Is this
a problem for anyone?  If so, please send an email to our mailing list
(<a href="mailto:cobertura-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">cobertura-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>)
and let us know what version of the JVM you would like to use.
</p>

<p>
Here are the changes in 1.2:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fix a bug that caused the XML reports to be invalid XML
(they were missing the &lt;/package&gt; tag).</li>
<li>
Use Java 1.4 pattern matching and remove Jakarta ORO.
</li>
</ul>

Just released 1.1!  It contains a few bug fixes, some feature
improvements, and performance enhancements.  Here's the list of
changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fix a bug in the syntax highlighting code of the HTML report
generation.  Previously, the highlighting for single quotes
containing "\\" would not end correctly.
</li>

<li>
Check the third party jars into CVS using the correct CVS
substition flag (binary, not ASCII).
</li>

<li>
Temporary files created by the instrument ant task and merge
ant task are now deleted after the ant task finishes.
</li>

<li>
Switch the instrumentation classes to use ASM instead of
Apache BCEL.  There are three benefits to this:
<ol>
  <li>
  BCEL was throwing exceptions with some source code compiled
  with JDK 1.5--ASM works fine.
  </li>
  <li>
  ASM is licensed under the revised BSD license, which
  is compatable with the GPL, which allows us to remove
  the questionable exception for BCEL from the license.
  </li>
  <li>
  Instrumentation is about 5 times faster with ASM than BCEL.
  </li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Modify the HTML reports so that classes without line number
information will appear as "Not Applicable."  This includes
skeleton classes, stub classes, interfaces, or anything not
compiled with debug=true.
</li>

<li>
Fix bug #1151777 with a patch from Jeremy Thomerson.
Previously we were not escaping some characters correctly in the
generated XML coverage report (specificially &lt; and &gt;).
</li>

<li>
Set the class-path in the cobertura.jar manifest file correctly.
</li>

<li>
Fill feature request #1151779 with a patch from Jeremy Thomerson.
This changes the structure of the XML report so that &lt;classes&gt;
are enclosed inside &lt;packages&gt;.
</li>
</ul>

Alright, everything is in CVS now and I've released 1.0.  Please
try it out and file bug reports for anything that doesn't work for
you.  I should point out that the original jcoverage has an
Eclipse plugin.  I don't use the plugin, and haven't tested it
in Cobertura, so I'm not providing a package for it.  However, I left
the build steps for the Eclipse plugin in place, so if you want
to use it you should be able to download a source distributable and
compile yourself.  The major changes between Cobertura 1.0 and
jcoverage 1.0.5 are below.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Applied a patch from Joakim Erdfelt to fix a bug where jcoverage
would fail to instrument classes if you attempted to instrument a
very large number of classes (in the hundreds).
</li>
<li>
Rewrote the HTML reporting and included code complexity in the output.
I should point out that parts of these reports are influenced by the
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/reference/plugins/jcoverage/">Maven
Jcoverage plugin</a>, the
<a href="http://www.cenqua.com/clover/">Clover</a> reports, and
the JUnit HTML reports.

</ul>

I uploaded the web page and did some initial project setup.  I'll
give my code a good once-over then import it to CVS soon.
