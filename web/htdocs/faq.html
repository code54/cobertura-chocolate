<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Where does the name "Cobertura" come from?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
"Cobertura" is the Spanish and Portuguese word for "coverage."  We
were trying to avoid acronyms and coffee references.  It's not too
hard to associate the word "cobertura" with the word "coverage,"
and it even has a bit of a zesty kick to it!

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Who started this project?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Cobertura was started by Mark Doliner, an employee of
<a href="http://www.sas.com/">SAS</a>.  SAS sponsored
the initial creation of the project, and continues allowing Mark to
maintain the project.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Why should I use Cobertura instead of one of the other code coverage
tools?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
We think Cobertura produces the prettiest output.  Pretty output means
it's easy to read.  Easy to read means you waste less time figuring
out where to add test coverage.  We also think Cobertura is easy to
get running.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
What do I need to use Cobertura?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
A computer with Java 1.4 or newer.  We have run Cobertura on
Windows 2000 and Linux (Fedora Core 3) using the 1.4.2 JDK,
however, it should work on any platform.  The Cobertura
download packages include all the dependencies you'll need
(ASM, java-getopt, log4j, etc.)

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Why did you feel a need to fork jcoverage?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
We felt it would be beneficial for the Java community if there were a
Java coverage tool with a more open development process than jcoverage
and Clover.
</p>

<p>
The GPL release of jcoverage had not been updated in about a year and
a half.  This in and of itself is ok, but the last release of
jcoverage (1.0.5) has a bug which causes jcoverage to fail in Windows
when used on a large number of classes (generally about two or three
hundred).  The bug is caused by the jcoverage ant tasks using a
command line that is too large for Windows.  You can see the
<a href="http://bugzilla.jcoverage.com/show_bug.cgi?id=16">original
bug report</a> and a
<a href="http://bugzilla.jcoverage.com/attachment.cgi?id=3&amp;action=view">patch
from someone in the community</a> in the jcoverage bugzilla.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
What about <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">Emma</a>?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
I've never actually used it, but it looks like it does a pretty good
job.  Judging from the sample on the Emma web page, we think
the Cobertura HTML reports are a bit easier to digest.  It looks like
Emma has some nice usability features, such as the ability to
instrument all classes in a jar file with one command.  A little
friendly competition never hurt anyone.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Can I help?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Yes!  Just check out a copy of CVS and start hacking.  Please try to
follow the same naming and coding conventions as the rest of
Cobertura.  Patches can be submitted to our
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=130558&amp;atid=720017">patch 
tracker</a>.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
When I generate coverage reports, why do they always show
100% coverage everwhere?
</p>
<p>
When I generate coverage reports, why do they always show
0% coverage everwhere?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Cobertura is probably using
the wrong .ser file when generating the reports.  When you instrument
your classes, Cobertura generates a .ser file containing basic
information about each class.  As your tests run, Cobertura
adds additional information to this same data file.  If the instrumented
classes can not find the data file when running then they
will create a new one.  It is important that you use the same
cobertura.ser file when instrumenting, running, and generating reports.
</p>

<p>
The best way to do this is to specify the location
of the data file when running your tests.  You should pass the
<code>-Dnet.sourceforge.cobertura.datafile=${basedir}/cobertura.ser</code>
sysproperty to the JUnit task.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Can I point the cobertura-report ant task to multiple source directories?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Unfortunately, no.  At this time Cobertura only supports one directory tree
of source files.  This is covered by feature request
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1170482&amp;group_id=130558&amp;atid=720018">#1170482</a>.
Ideally the ant task will allow multiple nested source directory elements.
</p>

<p>
As a workaround, you can copy all your source trees into a temporary
directory using ant, pass this to Cobertura, then remove this
directory once Cobertura finishes.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Why is Cobertura causing me to have classpath conflicts with ASM?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Cobertura uses ASM to modify your bytecode.  There are a few other
popular programs that use ASM: Groovy and Hibernate 3, to name two.
You could have problems if Cobertura uses a different version of
asm and you add both versions to your classpath.
</p>

<p>
Cobertura only uses ASM when instrumenting.  Cobertura <i>does not
need ASM in your classpath when running tests</i>.  If you're seeing
classpath conflicts, just make sure the asm jar that comes with
Cobertura is used only by Cobertura, and only when instrumenting.
