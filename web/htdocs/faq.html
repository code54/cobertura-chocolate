<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Why should I use Cobertura instead of one of the other code coverage
tools?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
We think Cobertura produces the prettiest output.  Pretty output means
it's easy to read.  Easy to read means you waste less time figuring
out where to add test coverage.  We also think Cobertura is easy to
get running.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
What do I need to use Cobertura?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
A computer with Java.  I personally run Cobertura from Windows 2000
using a 1.4 JDK, however, it should work on any platform.  I'm not
sure what version of the JDK you'll need, but you should be ok with
anything newer than 1.4.  The Cobertura download packages include
all the dependencies you'll need.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Why did you feel a need to fork jcoverage?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
I felt it would be beneficial for the Java community if there were a
Java coverage tool with a more open development process than jcoverage
and Clover.
</p>

<p>
The GPL release of jcoverage had not been updated in about a year and
a half.  This in and of itself is ok, but the last release of
jcoverage (1.0.5) has a bug which causes jcoverage to fail in Windows
when used on a large number of classes (generally about two or three
hundred).  The bug is caused by the jcoverage ant tasks using a
command line that is too large for Windows.  You can see the
<a href="http://bugzilla.jcoverage.com/show_bug.cgi?id=16">original
bug report</a> and a
<a href="http://bugzilla.jcoverage.com/attachment.cgi?id=3&amp;action=view">patch
from someone in the community</a> in the jcoverage bugzilla.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
What about <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">Emma</a>?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
I've never actually used it, but it looks like it does a pretty good
job.  Judging from the sample on the Emma web page, I think
the Cobertura HTML reports are a bit easier to digest.  It looks like
Emma has some nice usability features, such as the ability to
instrument all classes in a jar file with one command.  A little
friendly competition never hurt anyone.

<p>
Can I help?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Yes!  Just check out a copy of CVS and start hacking.  Please try to
follow the same naming and coding conventions as the rest of
Cobertura.  Patches can be submitted to our
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=130558&atid=720017">patch 
tracker</a>.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
When I generate coverage reports, why do they always show
100% coverage everwhere?
</p>
<p>
When I generate coverage reports, why do they always show
0% coverage everwhere?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Cobertura is probably using
the wrong .ser file when generating the reports.  When you instrument
your classes, Cobertura generates a .ser file containing basic
information about each class.  It puts this file in the current
working directory.  When you run your tests, Cobertura adds additional
information to this same .ser file.  If it can not find the file
cobertura.ser in the current working directory then it will create
a new one.  It is important that you use the same cobertura.ser file
when instrumenting, running, and generating reports.  There are two
ways to do this.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Make sure you start in the same working directory when instrumenting,
running your tests, and generating reports.
</li>

<li>
Pass the
<code>-Dnet.sourceforge.cobertura.rawcoverage.dir=C:\some\directory</code>
property when instrumenting, running, and generating reports.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In the future I'd like to change Cobertura to either throw an
exception and stop or at least print a warning message if it
does not find an already existing cobertura.ser file.
