<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Why should I use Cobertura instead of one of the other code coverage
tools?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
We think Cobertura produces the prettiest output.  Pretty output means
it's easy to read.  Easy to read means you waste less time figuring
out where to add test coverage.  Cobertura is also pretty easy to
get running.

<div class="question">
<p>
What do I need to use Cobertura?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
A computer with Java.  I personally run Cobertura from Windows 2000
using a 1.4 JDK, however, it should work on any platform.  I'm not
sure what version of the JDK you'll need, but you should be ok with
anything newer than 1.4.  The Cobertura download packages include
all the dependencies you'll need.

<div class="faq">
<div class="question">
<p>
Why did you feel a need to fork jcoverage?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
I feel it would be beneficial for the Java community if there were a
Java coverage tool with a more open development process than jcoverage
and Clover.
</p>

<p>
The GPL release of jcoverage had not been updated in about a year and
a half.  This in and of itself is ok, but the last release of
jcoverage (1.0.5) has a bug which causes jcoverage to fail in Windows
when used on a large number of classes (generally about two or three
hundred).  The bug is caused by the jcoverage ant tasks using a
command line that is too large for Windows.  You can see the
<a href="http://bugzilla.jcoverage.com/show_bug.cgi?id=16">original
bug report</a> and a
<a href="http://bugzilla.jcoverage.com/attachment.cgi?id=3&action=view">patch
from someone in the community</a> in the jcoverage bugzilla.

<p>
What about <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">Emma</a>?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
I've never actually used it, but it looks like it does a pretty good
job.  Juding from the sample on the Emma web page, I think
the Cobertura HTML reports are a bit easier to digest.  It looks like
Emma has some nice usability features, such as the ability to
instrument all classes in a jar file with one command.  A little
friendly competition never hurt anyone.

<p>
Can I help?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Yes!  Just check out a copy of CVS and start hacking.  Please try to
follow the same naming and coding conventions as the rest of
Cobertura.  Patches can be submitted to our
<a href="TODO">patch tracker</a>.
