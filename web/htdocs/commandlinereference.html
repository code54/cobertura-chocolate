<h1>Command Line Reference</h1>

<p>
Cobertura can be used either from the command line or via
ant tasks.  You can even mix and match the command line and
ant tasks.  This document describes how to use Cobertura
from the command line.
</p>



<h2>Instrumenting</h2>

<p>
<code>cobertura-instrument.bat [--basedir <i>dir</i>] [--datafile <i>file</i>] [--destination <i>dir</i>] [--ignore <i>regexp</i>] <i>classes</i> [<i>...</i>]</code>
</p>

<p>
Note: Classes may be specified individually, or as a directory tree containing multiple classes.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Required?</th><th>Description</th><th>Default Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>--basedir</td><td>No</td><td>Specify the base directory containing the classes you want to instrument.</td><td>No default value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>--datafile</td><td>No</td><td>Specify the name of the file to use for storing the metadata about your classes.  This is a single file containing serialized Java classes.  It contains information about the names of classes in your project, their method names, line numbers, etc.  It will be updated as your tests are run, and will be referenced by the Cobertura reporting command.</td><td>"cobertura.ser" in the current directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>--destination</td><td>No</td><td>Specify the output directory for the instrumented classes.</td><td>If no destination directory is specified, then the uninstrumented classes will be overwritten with their instrumented counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>--ignore</td><td>No</td><td>Specify a regular expression to filter out certain lines of your source code.  This is useful for ignoring logging statements, for example.</td><td>No files are ignored.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<p>
<code>java -cp lib\cobertura.jar net.sourceforge.cobertura.instrument.Main --destination C:\MyProject\build\instrumented C:\MyProject\build\classes</code>
</p>
</div>

<h2>Running Tests</h2>

<p>
You can basically run your tests the same way you always do.  The
only change you need to make is to your classpath: you need to
include cobertura.jar (which will include log4j and a few other
jars) and you need to add the directory containing the instrumented
classes BEFORE the directory containing the uninstrumented classes.
The order is very important.
</p>

<p>
Your tests do not have to be JUnit tests.  They don't even have
to be automated.  If your application is a program with a GUI,
you could fire it up, perform a few actions, then exit.
Cobertura updates its data file whenever your program is accessed.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<p>
<code>java -cp C:\cobertura\lib\cobertura.jar;C:\MyProject\build\instrumented;C:\MyProject\build\classes;C:\MyProject\build\test-classes -Dnet.sourceforge.cobertura.datafile=C:\MyProject\build\cobertura.ser ASimpleTestCase</code>
 </p>
</div>



<br/>
<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>
<code>cobertura-report.bat [--format (html|xml)] [--datafile <i>file</i>] [--output <i>dir</i>] [--source <i>dir</i>]</code>
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Required?</th><th>Description</th><th>Default Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>--format</td><td>No</td><td>The type of report you want to generate.</td><td>html</td></tr>
<tr><td>--datafile</td><td>No</td><td>Specify the name of the file to use for storing the metadata about your classes.  This is a single file containing serialized Java classes.  It contains information about the names of classes in your project, their method names, line numbers, etc.  Most importantly, it will contain the number of times each line of your code was accessed during your testing.</td><td>"cobertura.ser" in the current directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>--destination</td><td>Yes</td><td>Specify the output directory for the report.</td><td>No default value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>--source</td><td>Yes</td><td>Specify the directory containing the source code of your project.  This is used to calculate the cyclomatic code complexity of each class.  The HTML reports are also made of annotated versions of each source file, showing which lines of code were excercised.</td><td>No default value.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<p>
<code>cobertura-report.bat --format html --datafile C:\MyProject\build\cobertura.ser --destination C:\MyProject\reports\coverage --source C:\MyProject\src</code>
</p>
</div>
